What did I struggle with

It's hard to just pick one thing because it was almost like everything 
on this project was a battle. One thing I would like the point out which
I think was the most satisfiying to solve would be the update feature. 
I couldn't get it to work and couldn't find what I needed on google. I
messaged my mentor and he told me to look into patch. After messing around 
with patch for a little I got it to work finally and implemented it into the 
tracker and got over the hardest problem (for me) of the project.
